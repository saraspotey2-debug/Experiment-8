# Experiment-8
# Aim
Study of for loop in python.
# Theory
1. A for loop in Python is a control statement used to repeat a block of code multiple times. It is mainly used when the number of iterations is known or when you want to iterate over a sequence like a list, string, tuple, or range.
2. A for loop executes a group of statements for each item in a sequence.
3. It works as-Python takes the first value from the sequence, Assigns it to the loop variable, Executes the code inside the loop, Moves to the next value and Repeats the process until the sequence is finished.
4. The range() function generates a sequence of numbers.
5. Important Features of for Loop-Used for sequences (list, tuple, string, range, etc.), Automatically stops after last element, No need to manually update loop variable and Makes code simple and readable.
6. for Loop with else-Python allows an else block with a for loop.
7. Advantages of for Loop-Easy to use, Less chance of infinite loop, Clean and readable code and Works directly with collections.

# Conclusion
A for loop in Python is used to iterate over sequences and execute a block of code repeatedly. It is simple, efficient, and widely used for processing data collections.
